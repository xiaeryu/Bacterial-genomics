#### Step 1. Sequencing reads quality checking with FastQC
FastQC is a quality control application for high throughput sequence data that is freely available at
the [Babraham Bioinformatics Project site](http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/download.html). It can be called simply by calling fastqc followed by a list of fastq files to analyze. The results can be found in the same directory as the input file.
